# SoliSquire.

- "At your service, for this day and this day alone."

## Project description:

- SoliSquire is an app that allows a user to simplify their tasks by looking at the task from the user's feeling perspective instead of their urgency perspective. This will allow the user to have a better overview of which tasks will give them more sense of success and makes the user getting used to this way of prioritizing their tasks.

## Project goals:

- Simple and easy to use.
- Non-intrustive.
- Easy to understand.
- non-confrontational.
- non-judgemental.
- Accessible.
- Easy to share data with healthcare professionals.
- Easy to use in conjunction with other apps.

## Project features:

- Setting tasks. Tasks are only text and can be dragged into one of the 3 priority sections.
- The app will never tell when the user should do a task, but will give them a high level overview of their own priorities.
- The app will not have any notifications by default, but as the app grows with the user, the user can set notifications for certain tasks.
- The app will never state a task is not done or forgotten.
- Whenever a user finishes a task, the user can drag the task into the done section.
- The user can select whether a task is a recurring task, so when the task is dragged to the done section, it's not archived, but moved back to the suggestions section.
- The app will reset daily, so the user can start fresh every day.
- The user will be able to select a set of tasks that are recurring and will be added to the suggestions section every day.
- If theres a task that's been postponed for n days, the app will minimize that task, so the user can focus on the tasks that are more important to them.
- This app will be part of the Conqueror's Valor Vault, which is a collection of apps that are designed to help people improve their lives in various ways.
- This app is NOT designed as a task manager, but rather as a task prioritizer.
